This addon allows you to change between different talent profiles, and configure these profiles to prompt you when you enter an instance and more!

### _**[Project site](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/switchswitch)**_

### ***Features:***

This addon allows you to create multiple profiles of talents to be able to rapidly switch between them with a couple of clicks or commands (macros).

-   Create multiple profiles and store the talent build.
-   When switching talents and you are not in a rest zone, if tomes are available, a prompt may ask you to automatically use the tome to change talents.
-   Auto-prompt to change talents in instances.
-   Commands to change talents (for macro lovers <3)

### ***Usage:***

To create or delete a profile:

To create or delete a profile we need to open the Talent frame, once there you will see 2 buttons, delete or new.

The "New" button will take you to a popup to give the profile a name if it is available, it will take the current talent setup and saves it under the name given. If the name is an already existing profile it will ask you if you want to overwrite with the current talent setup.

The "Delete" button will delete the currently selected profile.

To change talents (switching between profiles):

To switch between profiles you can either: go to the talent frame, select the profile from the dropdown menu, or you can use the command /ss load profileName to load the profile.

Automatic usage of tomes:

If enabled (by default it is), this addon will ask you if you want the addon to use automatically a tome to change talents. This popup will appear every time you try to change talents but you are in a non-rest area (aka you cannot change talents).

Auto instance talent change (Suggestion frame):

This frame will help you to change talents more easily, to do so, once configured the profile for each instance type when you enter an instance, a popup will appear asking you if you want to change talents as you specified a specific profile and currently it's not equipped.  This frame will fade-away after a while (the auto-fade can be disabled). To disable this frame, simply select "None" as the profile in the settings.
